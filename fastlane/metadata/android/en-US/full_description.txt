GraphHopper Maps is an online route planner based on OpenStreetMap data and open source software. It calculates routes and alternatives very fast. It supports several modes of transport like car, bike, hiking, walking and more. You can add multiple stops to your route and on bigger screens view the road attributes like elevation, surface or max speed for that route.

After you calculated the route and your GPS location is enabled you can start the GPS navigation which guides you to your destination. Note, that this is an experimental feature.
